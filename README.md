Live Twitter Sentiment Analysis - Dash Application
This is the second version of my Live-streaming sentiment analysis application .
It is created using Python and Dash.



Repo Contents:
DashLayout.py - This is currently the main front-end application code. Contains the dash application layouts, logic for graphs, interfaces with the database...etc. 
TwitterAnalysis.py - This should run in the background of your application. This is what streams tweets from Twitter, storing them into the sqlite database, which is what the DashLayout.py file interfaces with.
requirements.txt - Contains all the libraries required for the project.
error.txt - maps the errors and notes them. (if any)

Quick start

Clone repo
install requirements.txt using pip install -r requirements.txt
Fill in your Twitter App credentials to TwitterAnalysis.py. Go to apps.twitter.com to set that up if you need to.
Run TwitterAnalysis.py to build database
If you're using this locally, you can run the application with the dev_server.py script. If you want to deploy this to a webserver, see my deploying Dash application tutorial
You might need the latest version of sqlite.

Todo List:

Improve the layout so that multiple analysis can be shown at a time for different topics.
Host the application to web server using dash.
Create a system so that the database automatically truncates after certain size limit is reached.
Improve the front end UI of the web server .
Add suggested tweet topics section pulled from the trending section.
